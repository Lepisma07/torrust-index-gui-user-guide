# Backoffice

Some settings can be customized by the `admin` role.

## Categories

Torrents can have only one category. You have to assign a category to your torrent when you upload it.

If the "admin" deletes the category used by a torrent, the torrent category will be set to `null`.

## Tags

Torrents can have multiple tags. You can assign tags to your torrent when you upload it. Tags are created by the "admin" and users can only choose from the existing tags.

If the "admin" deletes a tag, the tag will be removed from all the torrents that use it.
